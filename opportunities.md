**Research Opportunities**\
From incoming BWH WMH Fellow Natalie Feldman (2/9/22): 'I'm leading a group at Brigham and Women's conducting a massive review of the literature within postpartum anxiety. We're looking for a few more trainees (undergrads, medical students, or residents) to join the project. We're looking for a commitment of ~5 hours per week over the next few months. If you're interested in learning to conduct a review, interested in postpartum anxiety, and/or looking to join another publication, please email Natalie Feldman at nsfeldman@partners.org for more information.'
