The Reproductive Psychiatry Trainee Interest Group was founded in 2021 to connect and educate medical students, residents, and fellows interested in womenâ€™s mental health. We host monthly speakers on clinical and research topics within the field of reproductive psychiatry, panels on fellowship opportunities and careers in reproductive psychiatry, and social events including a book club.\
