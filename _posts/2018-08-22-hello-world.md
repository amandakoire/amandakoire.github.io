We want to welcome you to the National Trainee Reproductive Psychiatry Interest Group- we are elated by the support and excitement we have received so far, and we will continue to welcome new members. We had over 160 responses in the first week, and currently count >250 members! 

This group aims to provide some fun and engagement in topics around perinatal and reproductive psychiatry. We plan to have a book club, discussions about movies, and lectures and panels from psychiatrists in the field. 

We would love to start out with a Meet and Greet for those of you who are interested in being on the planning committee. Bring your favorite cocktail or mocktail (Amanda's holiday favorite is Trader Joe's Ginger Brew) and join us virtually on Dec 21 at 8 PM EST/5 PM PST.

If you are interested in joining and have not already received the event information, please email repropsychres@gmail.com for the zoom link and passcode!
